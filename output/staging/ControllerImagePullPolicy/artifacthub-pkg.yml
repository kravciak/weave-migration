description: "This Policy is to ensure you are setting a value for your `imagePullPolicy`. \n\nThe `imagePullPolicy` and the tag of the image affect when the kubelet attempts to pull the specified image.\n\n`imagePullPolicy`: IfNotPresent: the image is pulled only if it is not already present locally.\n\n`imagePullPolicy`: Always: every time the kubelet launches a container, the kubelet queries the container image registry to resolve the name to an image digest. If the kubelet has a container image with that exact digest cached locally, the kubelet uses its cached image; otherwise, the kubelet downloads (pulls) the image with the resolved digest, and uses that image to launch the container.\n\n`imagePullPolicy` is omitted and either the image tag is :latest or it is omitted: `imagePullPolicy` is automatically set to Always. Note that this will not be updated to IfNotPresent if the tag changes value.\n\n`imagePullPolicy` is omitted and the image tag is present but not :latest: `imagePullPolicy` is automatically set to IfNotPresent. Note that this will not be updated to Always if the tag is later removed or changed to :latest.\n\n`imagePullPolicy`: Never: the image is assumed to exist locally. No attempt is made to pull the image.\n"
